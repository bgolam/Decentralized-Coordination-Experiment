Four-letter-plus-one-digit codes are used to distinguish between different types of records 
within the experiment log.

The format of an individual record in the experiment log is as follows. 

###
[Timestamp]			// Single line
[Code]				// Single line	
[Contents]			// Zero, one, or more lines
###

The [Timestamp] is of the format hh:mm:ss.msc ("msc" stands for milliseconds; it always has three digits).

The "###" serve as record delimiters. Two consecutive records will look like

###
[Record 1]
###
###
[Record 2]
